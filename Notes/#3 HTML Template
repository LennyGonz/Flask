We need to create two directories:

1) Templates folder has HTML files
2) Static folder has CSS files, Imgs files, basically your non-changing files

main.py file:

from flask import Flask
from flask import render_template  #YOU HAVE TO ADD THIS TO RENDER TEMPLATES

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/profile/<name>')
def profile(name):
    return render_template("profile.html", name=name) # we need to insert the name of the html file
                                                      # we also need to include our name variable
                  # so we run the profile.html file and pass the variable: "name"
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()


profile.html file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title> profile </title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1 style="color: blue">Hey there {{ name }}</h1>
  </body>

</html>
