from flask import Flask
from flask import request
app = Flask(__name__)  #this the main website, name helps determine the root path, it helps Flask find other pages a lot faster

# we're going to have a lot of pages, so we need to do routing

#routing
# @ signifies a decorator - way to wrap a function and mofying its behavior
@app.route('/') # we want to connect a webpage. In this instance we only insert backslash **this is also a decorator**
                # backslash in routing is just home page (i.e google.com/)
                # lets say we want to make an about page
                # @approute('/about/')
def index():
    return 'This is the homepage'

@app.route('/tuna')
def tuna():
    return'<h5> Hello Niggas</h5>'

# We can create variables so if we run this and enter /profile/lenny
# it'll display hey there lenny
@app.route('/profile/<username>')
def profile(username):
    return'hey there %s' %username #from the url we're calling a function username

@app.route('/post/<int:post_id>') # WE HAVE TO PASS THE VARIABLE NAME: post_id
def show_post(post_id): #here in parenthesis we pass the variable
    return'Post ID is:  %s' %post_id

# The @app.route and function index, both work together to do something called Mapping/routing
# you need the return statement, because it returns whatever you insert after the return
# in our example we return 'This is the homepage'

if __name__ == "__main__": # this is a quick check, to make sure that we only start the webserver whenever this file is called directly
    app.run(debug = True) # all this does is say "Start this app"
